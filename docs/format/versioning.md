Semantic Versioning
===

The Semantic Versioning documentation can be found at their site. http://semver.org/

Versions are formatted as follows:

   `MCVERSION`-`MAJOR`-`MINOR`-`PATCH`-`BUILD`

`MCVERSION` - This is the minecraft version for which this release is built; EX: 1.6.4, 1.7.10, 1.8.0, 1.9.X

`MAJOR` - This number increments when API changes are performed. These changes are not
backwards-compatible and often require mods to perform a change to their code to accommodate the change.

`MINOR` - This number increments when changes are made which are backwards-compatible.
These changes do not affect the compatibility with other mods.

`PATCH` - This number increments when bugs are patched. No updates are required in another mod's code.

`BUILD` - This number is used to indicate beta builds on a build server.
