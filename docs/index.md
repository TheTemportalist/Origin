Learning how to Origin
==========================

Here, the docs will explain how Origin works. Origin is a library mod, commonly used for TheTemportalist's mods.
That said, you are welcome to use it as the basis of your own mods!

Docs site
--------------------

On the left is a sidebar with all the possible topics covered thus far in Origin's ReadTheDocs (from now on referred to as TheDocs).
To start understanding Origin, you must understand the versioning.
Begin with the top of the list on the left and work your way steadily through the topics until you become the master of the Origin itself.
